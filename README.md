# virtual-store
At first I was planning on making a basic virtual store to practice building out e-commerce features, but it turned into a project that I have been wanting to create for a whie whwere users can explore photos of pets in costumes, and rate them as either spooky or kooky. Users will be abe to see all the uploaded photos on the home screen, and rate each with buttons under the photos and see the amount of times each photo has been rated with spooky or kooky. Users will also be able to search photos by title and also filter by animal type, costume type, most spookies, and most kookies. Users can also see their own uploads and 

I started with just focusing on practicing my CSS and HTML - I wanted to focus first on creating a basic homepage with a Heading and Subheading and a basic stock photo, a search bar that appears (functionality added next), a list of images, and a footer. This allowed me to focus on practicing finding specific components on the page, and practice styling them individually and in groups. This allowed me to pracrtice resizing things, adding custom fonts, etc. using CSS.

reset.css file code comes from - https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/ - helps ensure standard styling is applied to project
